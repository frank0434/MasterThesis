# What is this book for? {.unnumbered}

This book is a supplementary material for my master studying on 
the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator next generation ([APSIMX](https://apsimnextgeneration.netlify.app/)).

- Why a book? 

1. I want to document the rational about the critical decision I made along the way.
At least in a code format so that I may recall in the future.  
2. Looks nice and easy to share with others.  
3. Github is free to host it.

- About the masters project 

The project aims to understand [Lucerne or Alfalfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa) 
performance under water deficit conditions in New Zealand and seek alternative 
ways for parameterising the APSIMx-Lucerne model. 

- About me

I'm a Data Scientist work in a reseach insititute called [Plant and Food Research](https://www.plantandfood.com/en-nz/) 
in New Zealand. I am also doing my master thesis at [Lincoln University](https://www.lincoln.ac.nz/) 
as a part-time student. The research topic I proposed covers three different
subjects: plant, soil and data science.
