**The whole project is based on [@Sim2014] PhD work. Without his hard-work, I will have no data to do the masters.** 


The eventual goal is to have an APSUMX-Lucerne model to simulate lucerne yield
under dryland conditions. Then we can use it to do _what if_ scenario experiments
_in silico_. [@Teixeira2020] developed the concept of using APSIMX models and 
[Rshiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to explore effects of management on crop
performance and potential environmental outcomes. Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig) 
demonstrates an example of lucerne yield map under optimal conditions. A robust 
lucerne model is essential to achieve this goal. The master project is set up to
start the journey of having such model. However, I only scratched the surface of
APSIMX model development for incoporating water deficit mechanism and the model
is still far from production ready.
